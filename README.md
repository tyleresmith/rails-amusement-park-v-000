# Rails Amusement Park

## Objectives

Get comfortable with using form helpers, having models interact with each other, and building out a simple sessions system.

You're going to be building an amusement park. There will be users, attractions, and users can take rides on attractions.

## Instructions

Building this amusement park will require the combination of a lot of the ideas introduced over the last few units.  The instructions are purposely limited.  Use the specs and the demo to drive what you build.

**This lab does not cover validations so please do not use them. If you do, your tests will break.**

* Check out [The Demo](http://amusement-park.herokuapp.com/) to see where this lab is headed.
* <em>Before anything</em>, note that when you generate models, controllers, etc, be sure to include this option, so that it skips tests (which are already included in the lab): `--no-test-framework`
* This is a test driven lab, check out the model tests and get those to pass before moving onto the feature specs.
* Remember, if you use scaffolds or generators do <em>not</em> overwrite the model specs that are included in this lab. Always enter `n` or `no` when prompted to overwrite the model specs for this lab.
